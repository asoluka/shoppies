### The Challenge
We need a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.

On this app, users are able to:
- [x] Search OMDB and display the results (movies only)
- [x] Add a movie from the search results to our nomination list
- [x] View the list of films already nominated
- [x] Remove a nominee from the nomination list

### Technical requirements
Search results should come from OMDB's API (free API key: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx).
1. Each search result has at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film.
2. Updates to the search terms update the result list
3. Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list.
4. If a search result has already been nominated, the nominate button is disabled.
- [ ] Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations.


### Extras
There is a lot to be improved on the sample but I decided to
- [x] Polish the required features by crafting a nicer design
- [x] Save nomination lists if the user leaves the page
